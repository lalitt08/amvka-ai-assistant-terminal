```

**Option B: Using Username/Password**
```bash
twine configure
```

### 4. Test Upload to TestPyPI (Optional but Recommended)

# Upload to TestPyPI first
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ amvka

# Test the installed package
